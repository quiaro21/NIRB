Only one script, self-contained, with the following commented steps:

Step 1: Loading the surrogate models
Step 2: Loading the snapshot matrices
Step 3: Normalizing the snapshot matrices
Step 4: Building the base using the SVD
Step 5: Calculate the reduced coefficients
Step 6: Training the neural networks
Step 7: Run the forward modelling using the NN
Step 8: De-normalize the output of the neural networks
Step 9: Error calculation on the 200 validation models
Step 10: Plotting the histograms.
